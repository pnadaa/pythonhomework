# Python homework
## Yippee!! Welcome to my little python mini project
### Functionality:
There are currently two functions: grades homework and karma. Both are incoorporated into a discord bot.
Grades homework stores the input grades in discord into a json file and is able to produce selected outputs.
Karma stores discord user karma and is able to increase or decrease the karma when there is a + or - in a message with a tagged member.

:) its so work in progress that the code is wild af
no discord api keys to be had here
